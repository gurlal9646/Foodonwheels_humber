              We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a single customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based 
              support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go through the maze of an call support. 
              Just search for your issue in the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. You can also email us your issue on
               support@foodonwheels.ca

               or call to do so. Once order is placed and restaurant starts preparing your food, you may not edit its contents
